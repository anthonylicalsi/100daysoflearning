#100DaysOfLearning
The goal is to foster a continuous learning environment to make us all better at what we do. In an ever-competitive environment learning and knowledge becomes critical to our long-term survival.

Rules:
1)	Do SOMETHING EVERY Day
a)	We should aim at 1 hour a day
b)	If 1 hour is too demanding based on your schedule, then do 30 minutes a day …. The main point is to do something every day.
c)	Developers should focus on coding every day or as much as possible.
d)	Always try to put into practice what we learn.
2)	Submit your progress DAILY for others to see
a)	The idea here is to motivate each other and to generate ideas from others.
b)	This is not a competition with others but rather a competition to push yourself to make yourself better.

What is SOMETHING?
-	Should be technology related
-	Any course (PluralSight / Udemy / Etc)
-	Code (Short code snippets or code a project)
-	Read a book about programming or various technology topics
-	Read Technical Articles/blogs about programming or various technology topics

Where can I submit my progress?
Internal:
Gitlab:  ex:  https://gitlab.bnymellon.net/XBBLF1F
Commit your changes with the following Jira - WEE-10328
https://jira13.bnymellon.net/browse/WEE-10328

Set a Goal and Plan:
It is important to set goals small and large.
There is no way to plan the full 100 days in advance but try to plan a few days ahead.


“One hour per day of study in your chosen field is all it takes. One hour per day of study will put you at the top of your field within three years. Within five years you’ll be a national authority. In seven years, you can be one of the best people in the world at what you do.”
– Earl Nightingale
